## Rationale

- Explain why you submitted this proposal specifically over alternative solutions. Why is this the best possible outcome?

## Solution

- How will we solve the problem? Describe in detail precisely how this proposal should be implemented. Include proposed design principles that should be followed in implementing this feature. Make the proposal specific enough to allow others to build upon it and perhaps even derive competing implementations.

### Specification

- Use example code, diagrams, etc to provide implementation details

## Reference Implementation

- This is an optional yet highly encouraged section where you may include an example of what you are seeking in this proposal. This can be in the form of code, diagrams, or even plain text. IDeally, we have a link to a living repository of code exemplifying the standard, or, for simpler cases, inline code.

## Testing (Optional)

- What is the testing plan? (other than load testing, all tests should be part of the implementation details and won’t need to be called out)
- When can we expect the results?
- What are the test results and are they what we expected? If not, explain the gap.

## Risks and Drawbacks

- Express here the potential negative ramifications of taking on this proposal. What are the hazards?

### Backwards compatibility

- Any backwards compatibility issues we should be aware of?
- If there are issues, how can we mitigate or resolve them?

## Future Potential

- Think through the evolution of this proposal well into the future. How do you see this playing out? What would this proposal result in in one year? In five years?

## Timeline

### Suggested implementation timeline

- Describe how long you expect the implementation effort to take? Split this up into stages or milestones for readability

### Suggested developer platform support timeline

- Describe the plan to have SDK, API, CLI, Indexer support for this feature if applicable.

### Suggested deployment timeline

- When should community expect to see this deployed on devnet?
- On testnet?
- On mainnet?

## Security Considerations

- Has this change being audited by an auditing firm?
- Are there potential scams?
    - What are the mitigation strategies?
- What are the security implications/considerations?
- Any security design docs or auditing materials we can share?

## Open Questions

- Q&A here, some of them can have answers some of those questions can be things we have not figured out but we should
